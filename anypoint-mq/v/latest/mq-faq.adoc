This document lists frequently asked questions about Anypoint MQ.

== Questions and Answers

=== Why is MQ not shown in Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint MQ requires a separate Enterprise subscription and is not included in the Anypoint Platform trial version. Contact your mailto:support@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft representative] for more information.

=== Can one listen to a queue and be notified when messages are delivered?

Anypoint MQ provides long polling. You can do a REST request and ask the server
to keep the socket open for up to 20 seconds to fulfill your request if there are not enough messages.

=== Can Anypoint MQ connector support be added to Mule shared resources?

At the moment, the only officially supported connectors and transports for shared resoruces are: HTTP/HTTPS, VM,  JMS, JMS Caching Connection Factory, Database, WMQ, JBoss Transaction Manager, and Bitronix Transaction Manager.

=== How do I get the Anypoint MQ connector to work with a retry strategy?

The Anypoint MQ connector does not exactly use a connection-based protocol,
but uses REST behind the scenes, and therefore,
you cannot use reconnection strategies with this connector.

On the inbound side, you can easily mimic a retry strategy using a max redelivery attribute set to your maximum number of retries and an exception strategy to move to a DLQ when the limit is hit.

On the outbound side, stick to the same triggering mechanism.
Otherwise you can use the until-successful building block with this connector.
