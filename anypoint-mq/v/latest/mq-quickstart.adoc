image:mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2]

Now you can send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ.

=== Creating a Client Application

To test your application, you can use link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio], which provides a connector that lets you send messages to your queue. Before using Studio, you need to generate a client ID and secret so that the Studio application can talk to the Anypoint MQ queue.

To generate the client ID and secret:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* from the initial Anypoint Platform screen or from the left navigation bar.
. Click *Client Apps*:
+
image:mq-click-client-apps.png[mq-click-client-apps]
+
. Click the blue plus *+* button to create an application:
+
image:mq-create-client-app-values.png[mq-create-client-app-values]
+
. Specify an application name such as `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
+
image:mq-create-client-app-name.png[mq-create-client-app-name]
+
. Click the client name to display the Client App ID and Client Secret values. We use these values after we install the MQ connector in Studio. For now, you can see that you can click *Copy* to copy each value separately to your computer's clipboard.

=== Download and Install the Anypoint MQ Connector in Studio

Anypoint Studio provides a graphic interface and web server for running MQ applications.
To use Anypoint Studio with Anypoint MQ, you need a connector to connect Studio to the MQ server.

To download and install the Anypoint MQ connector:

. In Studio, click the *X* in the upper left of Studio to start Anypoint Exchange, which provides connectors, templates, and examples you can use with Studio.
+
image:mq-exchange-x.png[Exchange X icon in the Studio task bar]
+
. In Anypoint Exchange, search for `mq`:
+
image:mq-apmq-connector-in-exchange.png[mq-apmq-connector-in-exchange]
+
. Click the blue *Install* button in the Anypoint MQ Connector item:
+
image:mq-connector-install-btn.png[mq-connector-install-btn]
+
Exchange prompts you for contact information and terms of service.
+
. Type your first and last name, email address, and telephone number. Click the checkbox to agree to the MuleSoft terms of service:
+
image:mq-install-prompt.png[mq-install-prompt]
+
. In the Install Anypoint MQ menu, click *Install*.
. Follow the prompts to install the *Anypoint MQ* connector and to restart Studio.

=== Use Studio to Create an Application

*Note*: If you want to create your application using XML or wish to check the XML as you go along, see <<XML Flow>>.

To create an application:

. Create a new Mule Project. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*. Name the project with a name such as "mqdemo".
. Search for "http" and drag the *HTTP Connector* to the Studio Canvas.
Here's how the Canvas appears after pulling all the building blocks to
the Canvas:
+
image:mq-connector-visual-flow.png[mq-connector-visual-flow]
+
.. Search for "set" and drag *Set Payload* to the Canvas.
.. Search for "mq" and drag the *Anypoint MQ* connector icon to the canvas.
.. Search for "logger" and drag *Logger* to the Canvas.
. Click the HTTP Connector and click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*:
+
image:mq-http-connector.png[mq-http-connector]
+
. In the HTTP Connector's Global Element Properties, set the host to *0.0.0.0* and the port to *8081*. Click *OK*.
+
image:mq-http-connector-globals.png[mq-http-connector-globals]
+
. Set the *Path* to `/mq/{messageId}`:
+
image:mq-http-path.png[mq-http-path]
+
. Click *Set Payload* in the Canvas and set the *Value* to:
+
[source]
----
#[message.inboundProperties.'http.uri.params'.messageId]
----
+
image:mq-set-payload.png[mq-set-payload]
+
. Click the *Anypoint MQ* connector, and click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*:
+
image:mq-green-plus-sign.png[Connector Configuration access link - green plus sign]
+
. In the MQ Connector's Global Element Properties window, add the information from Anypoint Platform:
+
image:mq-connector-properties.png[mq-connector-properties]
+
.. Copy the Anypoint Platform's *Client App* > *Client App ID* value to Studio's *Client ID* field.
.. Copy the Anypoint Platform's *Client App* > *Client Secret* value to Studio's *Client Secret* field.
.. Ensure that *Max Redelivery* is set to *-1* so that Anypoint MQ keeps retrying to deliver a message that is not delivered. The -1 value indicates that there is no limit to retries.
+
image:mq-set-max-redelivery.png[mq-set-max-redelivery]
+
For more information on
other options and tabs, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-studio#advanced-global-element-properties[Advanced Global Element Properties] in link:/anypoint-mq/mq-studio[Configuring MQ in Anypoint Studio].
+
.. Click *OK*.
. Click the *Operation* field and specify the `publish` operation.
+
image:mq-operation-publish.png[mq-operation-publish]
+
. Specify the *Destination* as `MyDemoQueue` that you set in Anypoint Platform:
+
image:mq-destination-queue2.png[mq-destination-queue2]
+
. Click the *Logger* and set the Message field to:
+
*MQ Message: #[payload]*
+
image:mq-logger-properties.png[mq-logger-properties]
+
. Save your project.

==== XML Flow

After you configure your application using the MQ Connector, you can check your configuration against this XML:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
include::_sources/mq-tutorial.xml[]
----


=== Run the Studio Application

In Anypoint Studio, click the project name in Package Explorer, and click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

The output should end with these statements:

[source,code,linenums]
----

== Test Your Application

Get a REST plugin for your browser so that you can send POST requests. Typical software:

* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb[Simple REST Client for Chrome].
* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman for Chrome].
* link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient[RESTClient for Firefox].
* link:http://www.telerik.com/fiddler[Fiddler for Windows].

The following is an example setup using Postman:

image:mq-post.png[mq-post]

To set up Postman for a REST POST:

. Specify the URL to send the message as `0.0.0.0:8081/mq/Hello`. You can also specify messages with spaces such as,
`0.0.0.0:8081/mq/My What A Great Message`.
. Click *POST* in the drop-down options menu.
. Click *Send* to post the message. You can send more than one message if you prefer.
. View the resulting reply from the Anypoint Studio web server.

=== Viewing Your Message in Anypoint MQ

To view your message:

. Switch back to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], and if needed, log in, and click *MQ* in the left navigation bar.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the right side to view the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-messages-in-queue2.png[mq-messages-in-queue2]
+
You can see the number of messages in the queue. Having verified that you have messages, we can now view them.
+
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the start of the entry to view the Queue Settings, Message Sender, and Message Browser.
+
image:mq-view-mydemoq-settings2.png[mq-view-mydemoq-settings2]
+
. Click *Message Browser* and click *Get Messages*:
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click a message ID and view the message to the right.
+
image:mq-click-id-to-see-msg2.png[mq-click-id-to-see-msg2]

You can repeat this process by returning to your REST POST application and sending and viewing more messages.
In the next section, we build on your knowledge, first with an administrative task of creating user roles and then creating and testing exchanges, which let you send one message to multiple queues.
