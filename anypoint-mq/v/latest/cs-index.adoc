= Anypoint CloudStore
:keywords: cloudstore, object store

Anypoint CloudStore builds on the Mule Object Store and extends it as a true platform object store that can be used for caching and sharing data across applications.

A person or an application can create as many object stores as needed to store different kinds of data. For example, an application can use CloudStore to create an API cache, an idempotent filter, or a way to store information to share between Mule workers, such as OAuth tokens. All of these would be different object stores that can be shared across applications.
