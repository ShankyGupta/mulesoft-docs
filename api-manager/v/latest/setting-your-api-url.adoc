= Setting the API URL

On the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page], you can configure the inbound endpoint of your API so that the Anypoint Platform can manage it, either directly or by proxy. Management controls on the API version details page might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].

== Setting the URL

On the API Version Details page, click *Configure Endpoint* to set the API type and an optional inbound endpoint for your deployed API. Provide the actual inbound URL of the API, not a placeholder URL.

If the API is deployed on-premises and you are using a load balancer, link:/api-gateway-rt/configuring-an-api-gateway[include your load balancer endpoint] here.

Identify your API Type as either HTTP, WSDL, or RAML.

|===
|API Type |Description
|*HTTP URL* |Select this option for non-RAML REST APIs. Provide the full URL of the inbound HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.
|*WSDL* |Select this option for SOAP APIs. Provide the the source where the Anypoint Platform can extract the URL. For example, you can set `http://myapiendpoint.com` if your WSDL is available at `http://myapiendpoint.com?wsdl`.
|*RAML* |Select this option if you designed your API using RAML and your API is implemented using APIkit. Provide the baseUri from your RAML definition. If you wish, you can replace the version with a \{version} placeholder. For example, http://myapi.com/\{version}/myresource/\{version}
|===

Click *Configure*.

The gray *Endpoint unregistered* indicator remains unchanged, unless you have declared an endpoint for an API that you deployed and configured with your organization credentials. When you link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[set up a proxy] for the endpoint and link:/api-manager/deploying-your-api-or-proxy[deploy the proxy] to Mule Runtime or API Gateway Runtime, Anypoint Platform recognizes the API and replaces the original endpoint that you declared on the API Version details page with the proxy endpoint.

If necessary, you can click *Configure Endpoint* at any time to make an adjustment. If you move your API, changing its inbound endpoint, repeat the previous steps and set up a new proxy for the API based on its new URL.

== Endpoint Status

After you declare your endpoint, the Anypoint Platform displays the state of that endpoint using a gray, green, or yellow status indicator.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Endpoint Status |Color |Description
|*Endpoint unregistered* |Gray |The Anypoint Platform has never tracked the endpoint for this API version. Either you have entered a URL for an API or proxy that is not yet deployed, or you have declared an endpoint that is hosted somewhere other than an API Gateway and need to proxy that endpoint so that the platform can track it.
|*Endpoint active* |Green |The Anypoint Platform is actively tracking the endpoint. Note that the endpoint must be actively tracked by the Anypoint Platform in order for governance policies and SLA tiers to function.
|*Endpoint inactive* |Yellow |The Anypoint Platform previously was tracking this endpoint, but the API or proxy application is currently offline. Hover over the status indicator to view a tooltip that indicates the approximate time the endpoint was last tracked.
|===

== Troubleshooting Endpoint Tracking

If you deploy your API or proxy, and believe it should be tracked, check that all the following are true:

* Your endpoint, configured in your API or proxy, does not have any trailing slashes
for connection to your Anypoint Platform organization.
* If you deploy to CloudHub, ensure that you correctly entered the client ID and client secret of your Anypoint Platform organization as environment variables.

If you deployed your proxy to a cloud gateway, your endpoint should match the domain you selected on deployment. If you deployed to an on-premises gateway, your endpoint is likely http://0.0.0.0:8081. The Anypoint Platform agent is tracking your endpoint using this URI, but the URI that you expose to developers can differ.

If you are running an on-premises API Gateway on your local laptop, other developers cannot use this endpoint from their machines.

== Endpoint of a Proxy

In API Manager, if you download and deploy a proxy, the endpoint is automatically updated on the API version details page to reflect the inbound endpoint of your proxy. API Manager recognizes the proxy URL as a stand-in for your original URL and updates it automatically on this screen. If you deployed your proxy to a cloud gateway, your endpoint should match the domain you selected on deployment. If you deployed to an on-premises gateway, your endpoint is likely http://0.0.0.0:8081. The Anypoint Platform agent is tracking your endpoint using this URI, but the URI that you expose to developers may vary according to your use case.

If you are running an on-premises API Gateway on your local laptop, other developers cannot use this endpoint from their machines.

Deploy to a URL that can be accessed securely by third parties and provide the IP address as an entry point for your API in all your documentation. For example, in all documentation for your API, replace http://0.0.0.0:8081/api with the IP address of the server, such as http://133.45.65.2/api.

You can also download and use a localhost tunnel such as ngrok from http://ngrok.com[ngrok.com]. You can assess whether this is appropriate for your use case and does not violate your company's security policies. If you use ngrok, be sure to turn off ngrok when you are finished with the tutorial.
