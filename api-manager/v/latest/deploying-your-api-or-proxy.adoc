= Deploying an API or Proxy to Mule 3.8.0
:keywords: api, proxy, gateway, deploy

You deploy an API or proxy to a Mule 3.8.0 runtime, or link:/api-manager/deploy-to-api-gateway-runtime[deploy to an earlier API Gateway Runtime] if you are running Mule versions earlier than 3.8. The Anypoint Platform controls that you use to deploy an API or proxy might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on the link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased]. Gateway and Mule runtimes have on-premise and cloud versions. 

To deploy an API or proxy to an on-premise Mule runtime, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/downloading-and-starting-mule-esb[download] and install Mule runtime before proceeding. 

To deploy an API or proxy to an on-premise API Gateway, link:/api-manager/configuring-an-api-gateway[install and configure] that Gateway runtime, and then deploy manually. 

To deploy to a cloud API Gateway, no configuration is required.

== Deploying Mule Applications

Save a proxy application as a deployable zip file. If you created or modified the file in Anypoint Studio:

. Save it and then go to *File* > *Export...*
. Select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, and click *Next*.
. Select the name of your application from the *Project* drop-down, and click *Browse...* to select a destination for your application file. Click *Finish* .

If your organization has On Premises Auto-Deploy enabled, and you have already configured Auto-deployment, then you can also deploy your applications on premises link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[via the Anypoint Runtime Manager Console].

If it is not already running, start Mule on the command line by running:

* *Windows*: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\mule`
* *Unix*: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/mule`

*Starting Mule as a Foreground Process*

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory.
. Run the startup script according to the options below.

* *Unix:* `./mule`
* *Windows:* `mule`

To stop Mule, press `CTRL-C` in the terminal in which the script is running.

*Starting Mule as a Background Process*

. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `<MULE_HOME>/bin` directory.
. Run the startup script with the `start` option.
+
* *Unix:* `./mule start`
* *Windows:* `mule.bat start`
+
To stop Mule, run the script with the `stop` parameter.
+
. Navigate to the directory where the proxy .zip file is located and copy the .zip file. Ensure that your copy of the file does not have any spaces in the name. 
. Drop the copy of the .zip file into the *`<MULE_HOME>/apps`* folder.
+*`<MULE_HOME`>* is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by Mule, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/mule-standalone-3.6.0/`.
+
Mule polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.

The API is deployed to the Mule runtime.

To stop the application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. This removes your application from the `/app` directory, which automatically undeploys it.

To update an API at runtime, drop a new .zip version of the app into the `$MULE_HOME/apps` directory. Mule detects this as an existing app update and ensures a clean redeployment of the application.

Now that you deployed the API to a runtime, link:/api-manager/setting-your-api-url[register the endpoint] with the Anypoint Platform, then link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[download a proxy] application to deploy to the API Gateway.

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Log in] to your Anypoint Platform account.
. First, ensure that you are in the environment that you want to deploy to. If necessary, click your username, then click *Switch environment*.
. Click *Add application*.

image:add+cloudhub+app.jpeg[add+cloudhub+app]
+
. In the New Application screen, give the API a unique domain name.
. Click *Choose File* and select the .zip file of your API.
. Select the latest Mule runtime from the drop-down. 
+
If your API has endpoints other than HTTP, Jetty, and Web Service Consumer, do not select the API Gateway runtime.
+
. Click *Create*.
+
The *Logs* view appears in Runtime Manager for tracking the status of the deployment. Watch for this message:

The API is deployed.

To stop the application, go to the *Deployment* tab.

To update an API at runtime, upload a new .zip file on the Deployment tab and click *Update*. CloudHub performs a zero downtime update using the new .zip file.

After deployment, you can link:/api-manager/setting-your-api-url[register the endpoint] with Anypoint Platform, and link:/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy[download a proxy] application to deploy to the API Gateway.

If you plan to expose your API through SSL, then there are a couple of link:/runtime-manager/building-an-https-service[additional steps] you need to take.
