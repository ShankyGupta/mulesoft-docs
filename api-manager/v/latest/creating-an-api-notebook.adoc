= Creating an API Notebook
:keywords: api, notebook

An API Notebook is a tool for building interactive tutorials and examples to present to users of your API. You can execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes. The Notebook is a web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs. A Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it you can perform authenticated live calls to an API, as shown in the link:/api-manager/tutorial-create-an-api-notebook[API Notebook tutorial].

In a code cell write the following method:
+
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
API.createClient(alias, url, options? cb?)
----
+
As you type this method, the API Notebook offers suggestions. These are the attributes you can use in it:
+
[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Req/Opt
|`alias` |The name with which you call this client from now on |Required
|`url` |A URL that directs to the API's RAML definition |Required
|`options` |It allows you to set default headers, a fallback body, etc. Type the method in the notebook and place the cursor on this argument for more details. |Optional
|`cb` |Pass in a custom callback to run when the client has loaded |Optional
|===

The Notebook can call an existing API, as long as it's published behind an HTTP endpoint. Through the MockingService you can call mocked APIs that are almost an empty shell to test out your API design.

Notebooks are composed of cells, which come in two types: *text* and *code*. Code cells are executable blocks of JavaScript, and text cells provide a neat way to display explanations and documentation. Text cells accept Markdown, so you can format your text to make it clear and readable. Any JavaScript is valid in code cells, you can even import JavaScript libraries and use functions from external libraries.

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm, that states that the same code is meant to be human readable as well as executable.

== Creating a Notebook

There are two ways to create an API Notebook:

. If you are an API Version Owner, edit your API Portal and use the left navigation menu to add a new API Notebook for your API version. Creating your API Notebook within the context of your API Portal automatically includes a line of code that creates the necessary API client for your RAML-based API.
. Visit the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site and create a new Notebook. If you want to save your work, log in with your GitHub account; your saved notebooks store as link:https://gist.github.com[GitHub gists].

== Sharing API Notebooks

To share an API Notebook that you create in an API Portal, you must share the API Portal itself. Either make the portal public or give other users permissions to view it. You can do this from the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page].

Notebooks that you create in the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site are saved as GitHub gists. To save a gist, log in to your GitHub account and authorize your application to write to the gist. Then click the *save* icon.

To share or embed your Notebook, click the *share* icon. You are offered two links, one for sharing the URL, the other for embedding the Notebook in a site.

Clicking the *Play* in the toolbar executes all code cells in your Notebook sequentially.
