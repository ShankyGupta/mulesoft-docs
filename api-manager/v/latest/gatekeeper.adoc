= Using Gatekeeper to Enhance Security

As a security improvement in Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and later, API Manager disables a managed API at initiation time until it applies all online policies. During the initiation, an API returns a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code until the runtime can communicate and retrieve and apply the list of policies.

Enable and configure the gatekeeper property to enhance security. By default gatekeeper security is disabled. To enable the blocking behavior, add and set the `anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` property to true in the Mule `wrapper.conf` file. For example:

----
 #On-Prem Configuration: 
 ...
 wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.gatekeeper=true
 ...
----

The gatekeeper feature is available only on standalone instances. Cluster support will be addressed in a future release.
