= Manage an API
:keywords: api, gateway, sla, policy, raml, portal, manage

As an API Version Owner, you typically add policies and SLA tiers to the API that you deploy by proxy. In this tutorial, you create two tiers of access for developers who want to call the API:

*  A tier that accepts anyone who wants to access the API, but limits this person's application to three requests per minute, and rejects additional requests.
* A tier for a premium access level that accepts up to five requests per minute and requires API Version Owner approval of the developer who wants to access the API.

API Manager sends an email for granting access to you when someone signs up for premium access.

In this tutorial, you also apply SLA-based policies to handle requests that exceed SLA limits that you added in the previous procedure.

* Throttling - SLA-based
+
Stores excessive requests in a queue for processing later.
* Rate Limiting - SLA-based
+
Discards excessive requests.

This tutorial uses features that might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].

. On the list of available policies, click the *Raml snippet* for either of the policies you applied.
. Follow instructions to add traits to RAML for enforcing the policies: Open API Designer and edit the RAML as follows:
+
* Add a section called "traits:" at the root level to define query parameters:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - client-id-required:
      queryParameters:
       client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----
+
* Reference the trait in each of the methods to specify that each of the methods require these query parameters. After each method in the RAML file, add **is: [client-id-required]**. For example:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/products:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
    description: Gets a list of all the inventory products.
