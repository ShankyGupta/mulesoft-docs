= Set Up an API
:keywords: api, define, creator, create, setup

You can set up an API on Anypoint Platform in one of the following ways:

* Using API Manager to define a name and version
* Using API Manager to link:/api-manager/creating-your-api-in-the-anypoint-platform#importing-and-exporting-an-api[import an API] that was exported from API Manager
* Configuring link:/api-manager/api-auto-discovery[auto-discovery] on the API to register it with API Manager

To set up the API for this tutorial, use API Manager to define a name and version.

To define a name and version:

. From the Anypoint Platform main screen or left navigation bar, click *API Manager*.
+
The API Administration page appears, listing the names of APIs, if there are any, that you are authorized to see.

The API version details page, which looks something like this, appears:
