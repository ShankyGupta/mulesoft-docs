To create an API, you need an link:/api-manager/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. You create an API in API Manager from the *API Administration page*, which you can access as a member of the API Creator or Organization Administrator role.

== Creating an API

To create a new API in the platform, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

The conjunction of API name and version is unique to the master organization. If you use business groups, the name can't exist in any of the remaining business groups or in the master organization.

Anypoint Platform uses the name and version to create an administrative command center for your API, called the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] in this document.

== Importing and Exporting an API

If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you can link:/api-manager/managing-api-versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.

To import an API:

. From the Anypoint Platform home page, click *API Manager*.
. Click the drop-down arrow in *Add new API*, and select *Import*.
. Browse for and select the .zip file that was exported from Anypoint Platform.
