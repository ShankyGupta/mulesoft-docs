= API Platform Architecture
:keywords: architecture, cloudhub, gateway, oauth

API Platform components are:

* API Manager: Software that communicates with your existing services, exposed as APIs and client applications
* Anypoint Platform agent: The API Manager agent that enforces security policies created with the Anypoint Platform
* Runtime Manager: Cloud-based API registry, governance, and engagement tool

The Anypoint Platform agent also plays a key role in the communication between an API and the platform. The agent uses OAuth 2 for authentication.

Anypoint Platform configurations are:

* On-premises
* CloudHub

Policy-related functions and some connection options and features described in this document might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on link:/release-notes/api-manager-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased]

== On-Premises

In this configuration, business logic, flows, orchestrations, execution, and message processing remain on premises, behind your firewall. API endpoint locations, service and application metadata, runtime policy definitions, and metrics reside at your location. The on-premise instance of API Manager supports creation of a proxy to communicate with your existing APIs, services, and applications. Sensitive information and runtime execution remain on premises, and your APIs continue to be accessible even if access to the Anypoint Platform web application and API becomes temporarily unavailable.

== CloudHub

In this configuration, a CloudHub instance hosts business logic, flows, orchestrations, execution, and message processing. Application data resides in secure CloudHub object stores and APIs.

The high availability architecture makes the likelihood of downtime low. However, in the event that the Anypoint Platform Web application and API are not available, Mule 3.8.0 runtime (whether on premises or on CloudHub) continues to run. Although you are not able to interact with the Web application or the API, all APIs registered on the Anypoint Platform are still available. Any policy information – including client ID information needed for policy enforcement that has been previously communicated to the agent and thus stored in the cache – remains in effect on any registered APIs. Thus, any time that the agent is unable to communicate directly with the Anypoint Platform, it perpetuates all instructions, restrictions, or permissions most recently retrieved, including client ID data, until it is able to refresh its cache.

== Agent Communication

To communicate with the API Manager, the agent needs to authenticate with the platform. The agent and the Anypoint Platform use OAuth 2 for authentication using the client credentials workflow.

=== OAuth Authentication

When you start API Manager (or upload an application to one of your CloudHub workers) the agent authenticates via OAuth with the API, which checks that the agent's client credentials are valid. The agent then sends a list of all configured endpoints to the API. Any matching endpoints registered in the Anypoint Platform are now tracked by your agent.

=== Policy and Client ID Enforcement

The following example describes how the agent and the API communicate to enforce policies at runtime.

. An API Version Owner registers an API endpoint in the API version page.
. The API Version Owner starts Mule 3.8.0 runtime or redeploys the application to trigger the agent to track the endpoint.
. The API Version Owner applies a client id enforcement policy and another runtime policy – IP whitelisting, for example. 
. An app requests access; the API Version Owner approves it.
. The app makes an API call to the endpoint. 
. The Anypoint Platform agent, which tracks endpoint as a registered endpoint in the Anypoint Platform, polls for updates on the endpoint policies at a user-defined interval, by default every five seconds. +
. The API returns policy information to the agent.
. The agent iterates through the list of policies and applies each one to the app's API call. If any one of the policy requirements are not met, the API call is not processed. In this example, the agent first checks that the incoming API call includes a valid client id and client secret by sending these values (if found) to the API for verification before moving on to the next policy, the IP whitelisting policy. For this second policy, the API would have already communicated the acceptable set of IPs to the agent, so the agent doesn't need to make another call to the API.
. If the app's service call passes all policy requirements, the agent allows the call through to the API. 

To minimize performance impact, policy retrieval is performed as a background task every five seconds. It is not necessary to hit the endpoint for policy retrieval to take place.

=== The Agent Cache

The agent stores policy information in its cache. If another (or the same) app hits the endpoint again within the lifespan of the cache, the agent doesn't ask for policy or contract information again; rather, it uses the information it has stored in the cache. +

The lifetime of the cache is determined by the API Manager. If, for example, Anypoint Platform sets the cache lifetime at 30 seconds, the agent will clean the cache after 30 seconds and make a new request for policy information when the endpoint is hit. +

If the agent loses connectivity to the server, the information held in the cache remains valid indefinitely. The following section describes this and other downtime functionality in further detail. +

=== Downtime Functionality

The agent does not have the opportunity to store the new policy information if the following events take place: +

. A new policy is applied to an API, or a new policy for an API is created in the Anypoint Platform.
. The API is never invoked after the policy is applied +
_and_ 
. An interruption of service occurs, causing the Anypoint Platform to go offline.

If these events take place, the policy is not applied during downtime. During downtime, the API continues to function as it did before the new policy was applied.

== Security and Reliability

API Manager is a multitenant application running on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Anypoint Platform runs inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), to which you must connect using an IPsec or SSL based VPN.

Data, metrics, and metadata cannot be accessed across organizations.

Although the Anypoint Platform can manage and enforce the runtime security of your services, the services themselves remain wherever you have them deployed. Only the configuration of the policies and the metadata about the services is stored in Anypoint Platform; the actual enforcement of the policies and contracts occurs "on location" at the gateway.

All communication between the Anypoint Platform and the agent, whether that agent on premises or on CloudHub, is performed through REST calls; OAuth is used for agent authentication. This counters any attempt to compromise the infrastructure through man-in-the-middle attacks or spoofing of services. The Anypoint Platform agent initiates communication with the API, also preventing any type of DNS type attack on your infrastructure.

The runtime components are insulated from external network outages since they store a local cache and can continue to operate even if the Anypoint Platform were to become unavailable. Regardless, MuleSoft maintains an SLA of 99.99% for API Manager.

The Anypoint Platform is certified via WhiteHat Sentinel. link:https://www.whitehatsec.com/sentinel_services/sentinel_services.html[image:WhiteHat.png[WhiteHat,width=150,height=25]]

* Anypoint Platform environments are continuously audited by WhiteHat
* Security issues (if any) are addressed immediately
* WhiteHat reviews MuleSoft operational processes and certifies them as secure
