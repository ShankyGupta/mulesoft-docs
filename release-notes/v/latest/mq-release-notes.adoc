== Known Issues

* If you need to specify UTF-8 characters greater than U+007F in a message that you send to an
Anypoint MQ queue or exchange, first link:http://uuencode.online-domain-tools.com/[uuencode] the message before sending, and use `uudecode` after retrieving the message. The use of `uuencode` makes the message into an ASCII text string.
* MQ is not supported for use with Internet Explorer 11.
* When viewing link:/anypoint-mq/mq-usage[MQ Usage], if you click another category on the Access Management page and return to the SUBSCRIPTION > *MQ* section, the download spinner continues forever. You can break out of this by refreshing the browser page or by exiting the Settings page and returning.
* Queue or exchange names containing the ‘#’ character are currently not allowed.

NOTE: For known issues affecting only the Anypoint MQ connector, see link:/release-notes/mq-connector-release-notes#known-issues[Anypoint MQ Connector Release Notes].
