= Using Policies
:keywords: policy, endpoint

A policy is a mechanism for enforcing filters on traffic. These filters generally control things like authentication, access, allotted consumption, and SLAs. The Anypoint Platform for APIs comes with a number of pre-built policies including Rate Limiting, Throttling, OAuth 2, Basic HTTP Authentication, and XML and JSON threat protection. Custom policies can be built to support needs not addressed by out-of-the-box policies. API Manager enforces runtime policies on HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. You can apply or remove one or more policies to govern your API version at runtime.

API Manager includes templates in YAML format that describe each policy and its configurable parameters.

== Prerequisites

Prerequisites for adding, removing, and applying policies are:

* Permissions
+
Organization Owner
+
API Version Owner
+
* A link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/setting-your-api-url[declared endpoint] for your API version

Prerequisites for policy enforcement:

* Registration of the API on API Manager

* Servlet Container other than Jetty
+
Due to a limitation in the Jetty transport, rate-limiting and throttling policies do not work on an API that uses a Jetty inbound endpoint.

== Setting the Order of Execution of Policies

You can set the order of execution of applied policies on an application in Anypoint Platform if you are using one of the following releases:

* Studio 6.0
* Mule 3.8 unified runtime
* API Gateway Runtime 2.2.0

*To set the order of execution of applied policies:*

. Assuming you have link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts[signed in to the Anypoint Platform], click APIs.
. Click the version number of an API, the 1.0development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service for example.
+
image:APIadmin.png[APIadmin]
+
. Click the *Policies* tab in lower part of API administration page.
+
The list of any applied policies and available policies appears. The list includes RAML snippets for enforcing policies in RAML.
+
. At the top of the *Applied policies* list, click the greyed-out *Edit Policy Order* button to assign the priority.
+
image:api-click-policies.png[api-click-policies]

. Set the order of execution of the policy to an integer greater than 2.
+
The order values 0 - 2 are reserved for CORS, Throttling, and Rate Limit policies, respectively.

You can also set the order of execution of policies for a custom policy by configuring the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-custom-policies#order-property-in-policy-tag[policy tag] or the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-custom-policies#order-property-in-before-and-after-tags[before or after] blocks.


== Logging of Policy Information

Logs show the order of policies:

== Policy-Related Notifications

When an Organization Owner defines the order of policy enforcement, conflicts can occur if existing API Owners have set policies on their APIs. The API Manager notifies both parties in the event of a conflict. An API Owner needs to update policies and resolve any conflicts.

== Available Policies 

The Anypoint Platform includes the following out-of-the-box policies.

link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Client ID Enforcement]:: All calls to the API must include a valid client ID and client secret.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]:: CORS  is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[External OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. You must reference an external application that serves as the OAuth provider.
HTTP Basic Authentication:: Enforces authentication per the details configured in a Security Manager policy.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ip-blacklist[IP Blacklist]:: API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ip-whitelist[IP Whitelist]:: All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses.
JSON Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager]:: Injects an LDAP-based security manager into the target API.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider] (deprecated):: Configures an OAuth 2.0 authorization server at the target API. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement] (deprecated):: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/access-management/external-identity[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement] :: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. This policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting – SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.
Simple Security Manager:: A placeholder security manager that can be configured with a hard-coded username and password for testing purposes.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Throttling -SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/client-id-based-policies[Throttling]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing.
XML Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious XML that could cause problems.

== Applying and Removing Policies

After declaring an endpoint for your API version, the following tabs on the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] become active: Applications, Policies, and SLA Tiers.

To apply a policy to your endpoint:

. Click *Policies* to view the list of available policies for your organization. 
. Select individual policies to read their descriptions. When you find the one you want to apply, click *Apply*.
. Depending on the policy, you may need to provide further configuration. See detailed instructions for configuring one of the available policies:

** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/ldap-security-manager[LDAP policy]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[AES-based OAuth policy set]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Policy]
** link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/openam-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[OpenAM Policy]
** External Authorization

A disabled *Apply* indicates one of the following conditions:

* Another applied policy fulfills the requirement (see the Fulfills column)
* Another policy must be applied first (see the Requires column)

To remove policies, click *Remove*. To reapply the policy, reconfigure the policy. Your previous configuration is not saved.

== Configuring the APIkit Console for Policies

You can apply policies to both the API and the console, or to the API only.

The configuration of the console determines how the RAML-based, auto-generated proxy is configured.

In this configuration, the console and the API share the same listener:

`<apikit:config name="apiConfig" raml="api.raml" consoleEnabled="true" consolePath="console" />`

In this configuration, the console is hosted using its own listener.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="console" doc:name="console">
    <http:listener config-ref="http-lc-0.0.0.0-8081" path="console" parseRequest="false" />
    <apikit:console config-ref="proxy-config"/>
</flow>
----
== Enhancing Security on Startup
As a security improvement in Mule 3.8.0 runtime and later, API Manager disables a managed API until all online policies are successfully applied. The API returns 503 (Service Unavailable) status code until the runtime can communicate and retrieve the list of applicable policies for an API and has successfully applied them. Enable and configure the `anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` property to enhance security. By default, this property is enabled.

In Mule runtime, the gatekeeper feature is available only on standalone instances. Cluster support will be addressed in a future release.

== Legacy Support

API Manager now incorporates the API Gateway runtime functionality in the April 2016 release and earlier. The following table lists the policy template name and the supported API Gateway runtime in April 2016 and earlier releases.

[width="70%",cols="50a,20a",options="header",]
