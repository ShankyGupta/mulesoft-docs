= Using Gatekeeper to Enhance Security

As a security improvement in this Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and later, a managed API is disabled until all its online policies are successfully applied. An API returns a 503 (Service Unavailable) status code until the runtime can communicate and retrieve the list of applicable policies for an API and has successfully applied them.

By default the gatekeeper security is disabled. To enable the blocking behavior, set the `anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` property to true. 

IMPORTANT: The gatekeeper feature is available only on standalone instances. Cluster support will be addressed in a future release.
