= Configuring Proxy Access to an API
:keywords: api, gateway, proxy, configuration

Mule 3.8.0 unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime. You can configure a Mule runtime or API Gateway instance from an earlier release to use a network proxy for channeling its communication with the platform. The instance must be paired with an Anypoint Platform organization (or Business Group). Use the following procedure to configure an on-premises API Gateway instance to use a proxy.

The only supported proxy authentication method in on the API Gateway runtime is Basic, NTLM is not currently supported in it.

. In Anypoint Studio, right-click your project name in the Package Explorer, select *Run As...* > *Run Configurations...*
. Select *Mule Application*, then open the *Arguments* tab.
. Copy and paste the following into the VM arguments box, leaving one space after any content that is already in the box: +

`-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server> -Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>` +

. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy by adding the following:  +

`-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication> -Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>` +

. Click *Run*.

. Open the  `wrapper.conf` file in your `<MULE_HOME>/conf` folder.
+

<MULE_HOME> is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by the API Gateway runtime, usually the root directory of the Mule ESB installation, such as `/opt/Mule/api-gateway-1.0.0/`

. Paste the following code as a new item at the end of the list in your file, replacing the value of   **`n`**  with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list. +

`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_host=<IP address or host name of the proxy server>` +

`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_port=<port number of the proxy server (default value is 80)>`

. Optionally, add a username and password for your proxy by pasting the following code as new items at the end of the list in your file, again replacing the value of   **`n`**  with the next incremental values over the previous entries in the list. +

`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_username=<username to use for authentication>`

`wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.proxy_password=<password to use for authentication>`
