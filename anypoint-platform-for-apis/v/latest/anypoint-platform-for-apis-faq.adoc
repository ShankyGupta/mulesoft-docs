The Anypoint Platform for APIs is a solution for designing, building and managing APIs throughout their lifecycle. All capabilities are accessed through a single, cloud-based environment to give users a 360-degree view of their APIs and API programs. The solution includes these core capabilities:

* *API Designer* – A complete suite of tooling for designing APIs developers love. Collaborate with API consumers to rapidly iterate on design, create and share use cases as Notebooks, and visually represent your API with an auto-generated Console.
* *API Manager* – API Manager provides a single point of management for APIs and service endpoints throughout their lifecycle. Control security and access, enforce SLAs, and monitor users and traffic to keep APIs and services running at peak performance.
* *API Portal* – An environment for creating portals to engage developers with your API. The API Portal includes tools for creating interactive docs, discussion forums, code snippets, examples, and a sandbox for testing your API.
* *Anypoint Studio* – A single graphical design environment for the Anypoint platform, Anypoint Studio accelerates developer productivity with an easy on-ramp for cloud and on-premises integration. Assemble your integration flow without coding using intuitive drag-and-drop tools or take control using XML markup.
* *API Analytics* – A set of interactive dashboards and reports for monitoring and measuring the health of your API program to continuously improve.


Most of the tools in the Anypoint Platform for APIs are free for developers to use. Registering for an account will allow you to create APIs in the API Designer, build out prototypes with Anypoint Studio, create developer portals, and perform other functions. When you’re ready to move your APIs to production and need a runtime, you can easily buy a subscription to the platform to access the on-premises or cloud-based API Manager.
