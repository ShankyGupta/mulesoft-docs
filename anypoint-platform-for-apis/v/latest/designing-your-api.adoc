= Designing an API
:keywords: api, designer, console, raml, apikit

API Designer is an Anypoint Platform environment for designing and writing a API in link:http://raml.org[RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML)]. API Designer supports link:/release-notes/raml-1-early-access-support[early access RAML 1.0]. link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/building-your-api[APIkit] and other RAML interpreting frameworks such as Osprey and JAXRS-Codegen can consume APIs that you create in API Designer.

The API Manager *Available Policies* list includes RAML snippets for enforcing policies in RAML.


== RAML 1.0

RAML is a structured, YAML-based language for describing REST APIs. RAML is machine readable--you can create tooling, automation, and repeatable processes for designs. You can describe resources, methods and other aspects of design, such as security, in a human-friendly, concise way. RAML 1.0 strives to fill the gap that exists in API design standards. Having a standard is important for communicating about the API with other developers, getting feedback, and arriving at agreements and contracts for API design. Facilitating communication gives RAML the edge in dealing with change. Getting insight into design at an early stage promotes refactoring on an exploratory basis and accessing the impact of change. You can communicate ideas to team members before coding starts, which promotes involvement in the development process.

RAML 1.0 includes a number of enhancements. The following list includes a few of the new capabilities:

* Data types
+
An efficient way to model data that uses simplified YAML-based, map syntax and can include examples and annotations. You can extend data types using inheritance.
+
* Examples
+
Named examples of instances of a type that documentation generators can use to provide sample values
+
* Annotations
+
Metadata you can add to extend the API beyond the RAML 1.0 specification or to enhance built-in RAML properties
+
* Improved library, overlay, and extension capabilities
+
More modular than in the previous version, capable of storing types, traits, schemas, and more in a reusable library. Use overlays to override or enhance your existing specification, or to keep annotations outside the main RAML definition. Create fragments and libraries that aggregate fragments.
+
* Better security schemes
+
Complete OAuth, key-based security schemes and extension points.

== Prerequisites

To use API Designer in Anypoint Platform, you need the following things:

* An Anypoint Platform account
+
If you do not have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signin[sign up now]. If you sign up for an account, you are given the Organization Administrator role.
* API Creator or Organization Administrator link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform#understanding-roles[role membership]
+
If you are not a member of one of these roles, you cannot see the *Add new API* button that you use to access the API Designer.

== Accessing API Designer

You can access API Designer in the following ways:

* From Anypoint Platform, using the procedure in the next section
+
You need an link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/creating-an-account[Anypoint Platform account]. If you already have an account, you need to have API Creator permissions to create an API definition in API Designer. If you don't already have an account, link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/#/signup[sign up].
+
* Download API Designer from link:https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer[Github] and follow instructions about how to run it as a standalone process in your local machine or embed it into another application.

=== Access API Designer from Anypoint Platform

After signing in to Anypoint Platform, follow these steps to access API Designer:

. Click *API Manager*.
+
The *API administration* page appears, listing the names of APIs, if there are any, that you are authorized to see.
+
. Click *Add new API*.
+
The Add API dialog appears.
. Enter the following required information, for example:
+
* *API name*: placeholder
* *Version name*: 1.0.development
+
. Click *Add*.
+
The API version page appears.
. In *API Definition*, click the *Define API in API Designer* link.
+
image:API+designer+link.png[API+designer+link]
+
The Designer has three panels:

* Files panel (on the left)
* The RAML editor panel (in the middle)
* The API Console (on the right)

=== Files Panel

The files panel shows the only file currently associated with the API, the one you are creating, named `api.raml` by default. Any imported files, such as schemas, that you use as `include` files appear in this list.

=== RAML Editor Panel

The RAML editor panel contains the beginnings of an API definition, the title and version number, generated from the Anypoint Platform dialog you filled in. The RAML editor includes the following functions:

* Checks and highlights syntax
* Provides instant feedback, flagging incorrect syntax
* Displays a shelf of clickable hints for inserting the next line of code

=== RAML Editor Shelf

The shelf of clickable hints about valid operations appears at the bottom of API Designer. The shelf displays a list of the elements you're able to enter at the location of your cursor. These elements are arranged into categories: Root, Docs, Parameters, Security, Resources, Traits and Types, and Schemas. When you place the cursor on a new line and in a different column, the editor recognizes that you are at a different level in the API definition hierarchy and have different needs. The Shelf changes to reflect your new options.

=== API Console

The API Console panel is located to the right of API Designer. Using the API Console and turning on the Mocking Service on the top, right-hand side, you can simulate calls to the API.

== Creating a RAML 1.0 API in API Designer

This example, which connects to a free online REST service, link:http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com[JSONPlaceholder], uses early access RAML 1.0. You can link:_attachments/placeholder.raml[download] the RAML 0.8 version, which is fully supported. For simplicity, the example API has only one resource.

The JSONPlaceholder service returns requests for user information in JSON. The RESTful API interface navigates the JSON resource, and provides all user information to callers.

When the RAML editor opens, it generates three lines of code based on the title and version of the API you provided in the Add API dialog:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
#%RAML 0.8
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
----
*To create a RAML 1.0 API*:

. Remove `#%RAML 0.8` from line 1.
+
On the shelf, the following RAML document versions and types appear, one of which is required on line 1:
+
image:raml-main10.png[raml-main10]
+
. Click #%RAML 1.0.
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
----
+
. At the root level enter the optional *baseUri* and its value, the JSONPlaceholder URL: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
+
The baseUri serves as an identifier for the API and forms the base of the URLs of the resources.
+
`baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
+
. Include the resources in the RAML, formatting each resource as URI relative to the `baseUri`.
+
For this example, the resource is Users.
+
Use a forward slash followed by an arbitrary resource name and a colon to enter the `users` resource in URI format, as shown in the following example:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
----
+
. Enter the method associated with the resource.
+
For this example, you need to specify the GET method to retrieve the information defined in `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`. Indent the method name followed by a colon on the lines below the resource name.
+
At this point the API definition looks like this:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
----

=== Use RAML Data Types

To keep your API definition as concise as possible for your consumers, use the ** `!include`** property to host documentation, schemas, and often-used patterns outside the definition itself. The Designer's parser interprets **`!include`** as if the content of the externally-hosted file were declared in-line.

To use RAML data types to check the user data that the placeholder API gets against a schema.

. Download the link:_attachments/user.json[schema file], `user.json`.
. In API Designer, click *Import*, and choose `user.json`.
+
The *Import file (beta)* dialog appears.
+
. Choose the `user.json` file you downloaded and click *Import*.
+
`user.json` appears in the API Designer files panel.
. Add a `types` declaration to the root section of the API.
. Add a line indented one level from the root, specifying the `user.json` schema to include to validate the list of users returned by the `users` resource.
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
version: 1.0.development
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
types:
  users: !include user.json
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
----
+
. In the *Files* panel, hover over `user.json`, and click gear icon:name[gear], and select Save.
+
Saving the schema you imported clears the error indicator.

=== Include Example Responses

. Enter `responses:` followed by the  response (required) to the `get` method and the example. Indent these entries as shown in the following example.
+
----
...
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
    responses:
      200:
        body:
          application/json:
            example: |
              [{
              "id": 1,
              "name": "Leanne Graham",
              "username": "Bret",
              "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
              "address": {
                "street": "Kulas Light",
                "suite": "Apt. 556",
                "city": "Gwenborough",
                "zipcode": "92998-3874",
                "geo": {
                  "lat": "-37.3159",
                  "lng": "81.1496"
                }
              },
              "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
              "website": "hildegard.org",
              "company": {
                "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
                "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              } }]
----
+
The response consists of a map of the HTTP status codes the API returns on success.
+
. To keep the API concise, you can use an include file for the example as follows:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json
----

== Simulating Calls to the API

You can simulate calling the API in the API console. 

. Above the API console on the right, turn on the *Mocking Service*.
+
In your RAML definition, the `baseUri` changes to a mocking service URI.
+
. In the API Console, click the *GET* tab.
+
image::designing-your-api-35775.png[designing-your-api-35775]
+
Click *Try it*, then *GET* to return the example data.
+
The user information in your example appears:
+
----
[
   {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Leanne Graham",
      "username": "Bret",
      "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
      "address": {
        "street": "Kulas Light",
        "suite": "Apt. 556",
        "city": "Gwenborough",
        "zipcode": "92998-3874",
        "geo": {
          "lat": "-37.3159",
          "lng": "81.1496"
        }
      },
      "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
      "website": "hildegard.org",
      "company": {
        "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
        "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
        "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
      }
    },
    ...
----

=== Calling the API

Using API console, you can turn the mocking service off and issue a call to get the actual user list, instead of the example data in your RAML, from the JSONPlaceHolder service.
