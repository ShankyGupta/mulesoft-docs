= Creating an API in Anypoint Platform
:keywords: api, raml, sla, gateway

You create an API in the Anypoint Platform from the *API Administration page*, which you should have access to if you are a member of the API Creator or Organization Administrator role.

== Prerequisites

This page assumes that you have an Anypoint Platform for APIs account and that you are a member of either the API Creator role or the Organization Administrator role. If you are not in one of these roles, ask your Anypoint Platform Organization Administrator to add you to the API Creator role so that you can create APIs.

== Creating an API

To create a new API in the platform, click *Add New API* from the API Administration page.

Fill out a *Name*, *Version*, and brief *Description* for your API, then click *Add API*. The name cannot exceed 42 characters in length.

The conjunction of API name and version is unique to the master organization. If you use business groups, the name can't exist in any of the remaining business groups or in the master organization.

Anypoint Platform uses the name and version to create an administrative command center for your API, called the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] in this document.

== Importing and Exporting an API

If you want to migrate or copy an existing API Version, you can link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-api-versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version.

To import an API:

. From the Anypoint Platform home page, click *API Manager*.
. Click the drop-down arrow in *Add new API*, and select *Import*.
. Browse for and select the .zip file that was exported from Anypoint Platform.
