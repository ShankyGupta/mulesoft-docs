= Engaging Users on API Portal
:keywords: portal, notebook, terms, conditions

API Portal is a tool for engaging API users. You create and manage an API Portal for a API version, including how to customize the content, configure privacy, and add an API Console and API Notebook to the portal as described in the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-engage[API Portal tutorial].

== Creating a Portal

From the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page], select *Create new Portal* on the dropdown menu under *API Portal*.

The Anypoint Platform prompts you to create a new API Portal or attach the API version to an existing portal to reuse its content. When you reuse an existing API Portal, the portal has a unique URL specific to the API version and displays API-version-specific content for the API Console and API Notebook. 

For more information see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-api-versions[Linking Multiple Versions of an API to a Shared API Portal].

== Customizing The Look of an API Portal

A portal is private until you make the content in it visible and switch the portal to *public*.

You can add the following content to a portal:

* <<Adding Pages>>: Write link:https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown[GitHub Flavored Markdown] text to communicate any other API information users might find useful.
* API Reference: If the API has a RAML definition attached to it in its API Version Details page, you can add link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/designing-your-api#api-console[API Console] to simulate API calls.
* <<Adding an API Notebook>>: If you make a portal public, using API Notebook, you can add an interactive tool to the portal for writing tutorials about how to use the API or integrate it with other services.
* Headers, which are displayed on the portal's left nav bar, separating the various sections of content
* External links displayed in the portal's left nav bar.

To add any of these to the portal, click the Add button on the left and select what you want to add.

Any changes you make to the left navigation are automatically saved. Changes that you make to the markdown pages need to be saved as drafts and published by clicking *Public*.

You can drag the section heading or any other left nav item up or down to reorder the items.

== Adding Pages

Creating an API Portal includes a single Page named *Home*. This is the landing page for the API Version. Use this space to provide users with API information. Add more pages to your portal to communicate any other information that you think your users may find helpful. Do this by clicking the *Add* button and selecting *Page*.

image:add+page.png[add+page]

Save and make the content visible by checking the checkbox of the nav item that represents the page. Click the visible icon. To preview the page, click *Live portal*.

== Adding an API Console

During the process of developing the API Portal, you have the opportunity to define the API in RAML. If you defined the API using RAML before creating the API Portal, API Console is automatically included in the in the left navigation. Click *API reference* to view it.

If you created the RAML definition _after_ creating the API Portal, the API Console is not automatically included in the left navigation of the portal. However, you can add it at any time by clicking **Add new... > API reference**.

== Adding an API Notebook

Add an API Notebook to the portal as described in the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-notebook[API Notebook tutorial].

== Making the API Portal Public or Private

An API Portals is either *Public* or *Private*.

* *Public* API Portals can be viewed by anyone, regardless of whether they are a member of the Anypoint Platform organization, whether they are signed in, or what permissions they have.
* *Private* API Portals can only be viewed by logged-in users of your Anypoint Platform organization who have Portal Viewer permissions for that API version. Unless you created the API version yourself, you must be explicitly granted Portal Viewer permissions. You inherit Portal Viewer permissions if you are granted link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform[Portal Editor permissions] for an API version. 

When you create a new portal, it is Private by default. Click the Private/Public icon on the top right of the editor to toggle the state of a portal between public and private. When you make the portal Public, it appears on the Developer Portal to everyone, including anonymous users. Anyone can discover the API, access its API Portal, and see any documentation that you have published there.

== Developer Portal

Users who are not Organization Administrators or API Creators can use the developer portal for their organization: anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/<organization>. To access the developer portal for an organization from the *API administration* page, click the hamburger menu and select *Developer portal*.

A Developer Portal has the following tabs:

* API portals
+
// 1.10.0 (kris) Users can search, browse, and sort API portals on this page, then navigate to a specific API. Use the sort icon by *API name* to sort portals.
// +
// image::engaging-users-of-your-api-cf71a.png[engaging-users-of-your-api-cf71a]
// +
Anonymous users can view any API portals that have been made Public.
// +
* My applications
// +
This tab lists apps approved to access the API on the *My Applications* tab. 

// On this tab, you can search and sort apps. 

Subject to role and permissions, the developer portal has access controls for removing app access privileges. Delete the app from the portal to remove access privileges. You can also reset the client ID and client secret.

== Skinning the API Portal

Adjust the look and feel of an API Portal by clicking the Themes icon on the top right of the editor. Clicking *API Portal Theme Settings* opens the API Portal Theme Settings interface.

Add your own logo and choose the colors for the different elements in the top nav bar, either from a palette or by typing Hex color codes. The changes you make are reflected affect only the API Portal.

=== Setting up a Universal Skin for API Portals

If you have multiple API Portals, you can set up a universal theme to apply to every API Portal in your organization and its business group. Go to the API Administration page, click the hamburger icon on the top-right of the screen and select *Developer portal theme settings*.

image:universal+themes.png[universal+themes]

If you apply settings at the Master Organization level, the theme is used in the API Portals of all your business groups. If you apply settings at the API Administration level for an individual business group, the theme overrides the theme defined at a higher level and affects only the API Portals of that business group.

== Adding Images and Attachments

You can upload attachments and images for display within API Portal as described in the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-engage[API Portal tutorial]. Images and attachments that you upload to API Portal are removed if you delete the API Portal where you uploaded them.

API Portal supports the following types of images:

* PNG
* JPEG
* SVG
* GIF
* WEBP
* BMP

You can add images or attachments up to 5MB in size. Host images larger than 5MB on an external site and link to those images from API Portal. Linking to attachments is not supported.

To include an image in API Portal, click the image icon outlined below.

image:empty_portal-image.png[empty_portal-image]

To link to an image, use an absolute URL, including protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and full path, such as `http://example.com/my_image.png`.

image:linking_image.png[linking_image]

If you link to an image, API Portal displays the image but does not store it. If the real image is deleted (i.e. deleted from the external host), the image will cease to be available on API Portal.

Images you upload or link to are displayed in API Portal.

== Removing Images or Attachments

To remove an image or attachment, hover over it. Click the Trash icon, then click *Delete* to confirm the operation.

== Previewing a Portal

While still developing your portal, you can click the icon labeled *Live Portal* on the top right of the editor to preview how your portal looks so far.

== Deleting Elements

To delete any element, such as a markup page, an API Notebook, or the API Reference, select the checkbox for the element on the left menu, then click the trashcan icon. Confirm that you want to delete the element.

== Adding Terms and Conditions

You can define two levels of terms and onditions regarding the use of an API portal by visitors.

* Portal Terms and Conditions
+
Must be accepted before any access to the developer portal.
* API Access Terms and Conditions
Must be accepted before attempting to register an application through the API portal.

Once you have saved a set of terms of conditions, these will be automatically applied to all the APIs in your organization, no further steps are required.

The current text of the terms and conditions will be recorded on the user's profile. This ensures that, in case these terms and conditions change, the user's contract remains as what he agreed to.

The sections below describe each type of T&C and their behaviour in more details.

=== Portal Terms and Conditions

Portal terms and conditions are configured using markdown at the API administration page and are globally set for access to the API developer portals for your entire organization.

image:portal_tc.png[Portal TC]

When set, a T&C acceptance screen will be displayed to users upon their first access to the organization developer portal page, and thereupon, presented again every time the T&C content is changed.

=== Request API Access Terms and Conditions

Request API Access T&Cs are presented to users upon registration of an application for an API through the API’s developer portal.

image:terms+an+co+3.jpeg[terms+an+co+3]

Request API Access T&Cs can be configured in two ways: They can be set at a global level through the API admin page as illustrated below, in which case they will apply to all APIs within the organization.

image:request_tc.png[Request API Access TC]

API owners, can also set at an API version specific Request API Access T&Cs, using the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/walkthrough-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page] as shown below. These T&Cs override the global Request API Access T&Cs when defined.

image:request_tc2.png[Request API Access TC]

=== Organizations with Multiple Business Groups

If you apply these settings at the Master Organization level, these terms and conditions will be used in the APIs of every one of your business groups. If you apply this within the API Administration page of an individual business group, the terms and conditions you set up will override the ones defined at a higher level and affect only the APIs of that business group.
