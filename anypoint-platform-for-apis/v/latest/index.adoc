The API Manager on the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/home/#/[Anypoint Platform web site] opens the API Administration page for designing, building, managing, and publishing APIs.

Visible only to link:/access-management/roles[certain roles], namely Organization Administrators, API Creators, and API Version Owners, the API Administration page is an administrative view of the APIs currently registered in the platform. From this view, API Creators and Organization Administrators can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs, and API Version Owners can access the API version details pages for the specific API versions to which they have been granted API Version Owner permissions.

On the API Administration page, *Add new API* imports an existing API or adds a definition, typically just the API name and version. The API Administration page also lists the names and versions of the APIs you define or import. To start an API management task, click a version name. A page of controls for performing API management tasks on the selected version appears. For example:
