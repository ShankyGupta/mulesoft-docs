:keywords: user guide, api

This guide includes how to design, develop, and manage APIs in Anypoint Platform using tools that you access from API Manager:

* API Designer, the custom environment for defining an API in RAML

* An analytics dashboard (anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics), one or more charts that display metrics for the APIs registered in your organization

* API Portal for publishing your API and related information, such as documentation

* API Notebook (anypoint.mulesoft.com/apinotebook), a versatile interactive JavaScript programming environment that you can embed in API Portal to demonstrate calls to an API for example

* API Console that you can use with API Designer to simulate calls to the API

The User Guide describes features that might not be visible or accessible to you, depending on the link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].
