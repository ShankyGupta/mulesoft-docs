= Deploy the API
:keywords: api, gateway, apikit, deploy

// Obsolete doc (kris 6.30.2016)

This walkthrough covers how to deploy the t-shirt API you created earlier. 

The endpoint you created for the API is tagged  "Not registered": At the bottom of the page, `There are no registered applications for this API Version` displays.

In order to manage the API behind this endpoint with SLAs and policies, the Anypoint Platform for APIs needs to register the endpoint with the agent.

. Click *Deploy Proxy* under API Status:

. If no changes are needed, click *Close*:

+
You can select the option to create a new API Gateway instance on your computer and manage the instance using link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#add-a-server[Servers].
+
. To download a proxy for your API, click *Download proxy (for latest gateway version)*:
+

+
Anypoint Platform automatically downloads the proxy as a .zip file.

Downloading a proxy if you're planning to deploy your proxy on premises or to deploy to CloudHub manually.

If you plan to deploy to CloudHub automatically, then there's no need to download the proxy.
