[NOTE]
====
Deploy apps using the Runtime Manager through either the cloud-based or the on-prem versions of the Anypoint Platform. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-mule[CloudHub and Mule] for a better understanding of the differences between both.

== Overview

Runtime Manager is the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-platform-primer[Anypoint Platform] tool used to deploy and manage all of your link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/begin-with-the-basics[Mule applications] in one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud or on-premises.

After you have created a Mule application (for example, see link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/build-a-hello-world-application[Hello World Mule application]), you can deploy to either CloudHub, our cloud iPaaS platform, or to one of your own servers, server groups, or clusters.

Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.

Managing Mule runtime with both Mule Management Console (MMC) and Runtime Manager is _not_ supported.

== Deploy, Monitor and Manage Applications


=== 1. Create a Mule Application

== Deployment Context

In Anypoint Studio, hitting the *Play* icon (or from Package Explorer right-clicking project and *Run As* > *Mule Application*), deploys your application to an embedded test server that is built into Studio. This server is not meant for production deployment. Ultimately you will want to deploy your application to either link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] or a Mule Runtime instance running on a server, *both of which are managed via the Runtime Manager*.

After software developer teams create a Mule application they typically pass the application to a QA team that deploys the application to a simulated test environment. Barring any issues, the application is passed to a third team that runs it in a production environment, with strict requirements for constant availability, performance rates, and continuous uptime.

The Runtime Manager is an enterprise tool that provides a centralized, convenient, and intuitive web-based interface to monitor and manage aspects of Mule runtime. Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule runtime instances, and can do so in various environments, providing comprehensive functionality for managing Mule apps in CloudHub virtual workers, servers, server groups, clusters, allowing you to work with the applications (and the application's flows) running on Mule instances.

[TIP]
A downloadable version also exists as part of the Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition that runs entirely on-premises, allowing you to keep all of your infrastructure secure under your required policies. If you are interested in requesting the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition, please contact your sales representative.


[INFO]
For managing apps on your own servers, you can still resort to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/index[Mule Management Console] as an alternative to the Runtime Manager. This tool is no longer being developed, but has some features that are currently not yet implemented in the Runtime Manager for on-premise deployment scenarios.
