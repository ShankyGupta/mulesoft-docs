= Monitor B2B Transactions

Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) enables you to monitor B2B _transaction_ data.
A transaction is the full set of end-to-end events (including transmissions, documents, and errors) involved in processing a transmission.

You can:

* Filter to find the specific transaction data for which you are looking
* Review and monitor errors and acknowledgements.
* Search for metadata

This page identifies the APM components you use to monitor transactions. For information about transaction-monitoring scenarios, see "Tracking" in link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager-concepts[Anypoint Partner Manager Concepts]

== Central Pane elements

=== View Options Dropdown Menu

This menu, at the upper left of the Central Pane, presents the following view choices:

* Transmissions
* Transactions
* Errors
* Documents

The data that appears in the <<Content Area>> depends on the menu option you choose here.

=== Dashboard

* Top of pane
* Provides status based on timeframe you select in the dropdown list at the upper left.

==== Overview data

Given for:

* Transmissions
* Transactions

Given in:

Numerical form:: The actual number

Pie chart::
* A representation of the data as a percentage of... <cooper>
* When you hover over or click on a section of the error pie chart, the section illuminates and provides the number corresponding to that section.

=== Filter bar

* Enables you to filter data for quick navigation
* Bottom of pane

The filter bar allows users to filter through the results of the view and find exactly what they are looking for. It is different for each view depending on what the user would want to filter by. The example here is for the Errors page.

Clicking on the down arrow here allows you to pick what you want to filter by. For example if you click on Partners you will see the following:

You can click on any of the pluses to filter by that company, or click on multiple of them to filter by more than one company. You also have the option of searching through all the partners with a search bar. When you add a filter the partner light will turn blue to let you know you have an active filter.

You can remove any filters at anytime, or click on the blue partner toggle button to disable the overarching filter

=== Content area

A table appears in the lower part of the Central Pane. Table column headings may be changed based on the choices you make in <<Overview Data>>. Possible views include:

==== Error View
This view is probably the most used view and is seen above. The 5 columns are fairly simple, but each one has a different Detail View when we click on it. Each one of these errors has buttons in the top navigation bar that lets you navigate through the error to see where it is coming from. Not all errors can be viewed in the same way and this is addressed by which buttons are available.

===== Duplicate Error

===== Functional Acknowledgement Error

===== Transport Acknowledgement Error

===== Exception Error


===== Languishing Error

==== Transmission View

This view presents all recent transmissions. These are sorted by how recently they came in and have a status of whether or not they errored out. Clicking on these rows brings up the detailed view which explains more about each transmission. Again each detail view also allows for navigation to other levels, this is especially useful for seeing what business process a particular transmission is associated with.

===== AS2 Transmission Detail

===== FTPS Transmission Detail

==== Transactions View
Here we have the chance to view all of the different Transactions. They show their status with colors and obvious shapes to help our users know exactly what is going on. When expanded we have the ability to view all the different events associated with the transaction and the chance to view the transmission or the error if there is an error.

===== Detail View

==== Document View
Here we see a simple document view as well. This is very simple and shows you exactly what you need. Clicking on a row brings up the detail view.

==== File Name

Search for a specific file by its specific filename, or for all files that start with the same text.

==== Control #

Search for a message by Control# (only enabled when the Type is X12 or EDIFACT).

==== Metadata search



The fields are defined by name value pairs in the Anypoint work flow, which need to be done prior to using this specific search function (By your Developer) The meta data search will allow you to search for frequently used data queries inside your B2B transactions. An example would be if container was defined (in the Anypoint work flow) and you enter that defined value for Container (In what specific field in X12 or EDIFACT) and then the agreed upon name in the MetaData field and then in the value field the value you are searching for, say Container# CSQU3054383. If there are any matching documents, they will show in the results field.
