= Deploying an APIkit project
:keywords: deploy, api, runtime, apikit, gateway

If your APIkit project includes only HTTP/S, Jetty, and/or Web Service Consumer connectors and/or a maximum of two additional connectors, deploy to an API Gateway Runtime 2.x or 1.3.x.

If your APIkit project includes one or more connectors other than HTTP/S, Jetty, and/or Web Service Consumer and the allotted two additional connectors, deploy to a Mule runtime.

== Deploying an APIkit Project to On-Premise or Cloud Mule Runtime

This procedure assumes that you have completed the APIkit tutorial  link:/quickstarts/implement-and-test#create-a-project-based-on-a-raml[or other APIkit project]. Your APIkit project should be saved as a deployable zip file. If you didn't create your own APIkit project but you want to jump in here, you can download and use **link:_attachments/my-raml-implementation.zip[this project]**. +

Download the .zip file, go to Studio, click on "File", then "Import", select "Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (zip)" and import your downloaded zip file.

Deploy an APIkit project to an On-Premise or Cloud Mule runtime. CloudHub deployment might not be available to you depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].

. If you have not downloaded the Mule standalone runtime, click link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Installing[here] and follow the steps to install the latest version.
. Start Mule in the command line by running:
+
Windows: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\mule`
+
Mac and Unix: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/mule`
+
[TIP]
*`<MULE_HOME`>* is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by Mule, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/mule-standalone-3.8.0/`

. Navigate to the directory where the .zip file is located and copy the .zip file. Ensure that your copy of the file does not have any spaces in the name. 
. Drop the copy of the .zip file into the `<MULE_HOME>/apps` folder.
. Mule polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.
. When you see the message `Started app 'TshirtService'`, then your API is deployed to the Mule runtime.

If you wish to undeploy your application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. This removes your application from the `/app` directory, which automatically undeploys it.

. Your project has a node in the Package Explorer. Right-click on the project node and then click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* > *Cloud* from the cascading menu.

. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub. You can manage these credentials through the Studio Preferences menu, in Anypoint Studio > Authentication.
. After you sign in, the Deploy to Runtime Manager menu opens. Choose a unique domain in which to deploy the application. In this case, we enter helloworld (however, you can choose your own unique domain of up to 42 characters in length). When you choose a unique domain name, a green confirmation check mark displays. 
. Select an Environment and a Mule Version.
+
After you add your domain name, the Mule Version fills in automatically. Click *Finish*.

Anypoint Studio packages, uploads, and deploys your application to CloudHub.
. Browse to the URL of yourdomain.cloudhub.io (also shown in the pop-up window above). You should see your application running via the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager].

To stop the application, click the *Settings* tab and click *Cancel deployment*.

== Deploying an APIkit Project in Studio

If you created or modified the file in Anypoint Studio:

. Save it and then go to *File* > *Export...*
. Select *Anypoint Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive (includes Studio metadata)*, and click *Next*.
. Select the name of your application from the *Project* drop-down, and click *Browse...* to select a destination for your application file. Click *Finish* .

If your organization has On Premises Auto-Deploy enabled, and you have already configured Auto-deployment, then you can also deploy your applications on premises link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[via the Anypoint Runtime Manager Console].
