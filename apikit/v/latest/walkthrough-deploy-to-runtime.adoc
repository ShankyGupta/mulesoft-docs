= Deploy an APIkit project
:keywords: deploy, api, runtime, apikit, gateway

This procedure assumes that you have completed the APIkit tutorial  link:/quickstarts/implement-and-test#create-a-project-based-on-a-raml[or other APIkit project]. Your APIkit project should be saved as a deployable zip file. If you didn't create your own APIkit project but you want to jump in here, you can download and use **link:_attachments/my-raml-implementation.zip[this project]**. +

Download the .zip file, go to Studio, click on "File", then "Import", select "Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (zip)" and import your download zip file.

== Deploying

Deploy an APIkit project to a Mule runtime of your choice, including the runtime running on your localhost machine. To make the API accessible to other Anypoint Platform users or to the API Console (which accesses your API through a Web proxy), your API must be implemented on a server location that is accessible via the Web. For this reason, we recommend that you deploy to a runtime on CloudHub or to a server with an IP address that can be accessed from the Web. CloudHub deployment might not be available to you depending on link:/release-notes/anypoint-platform-for-apis-release-notes#april-2016-release[entitlements you purchased].

. If you have not downloaded the Mule standalone runtime, click link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Installing[here] and follow the steps to install the latest version.
. Start Mule in the command line by running:
+
Windows: `<MULE_HOME>\bin\mule`
+
Mac and Unix: `<MULE_HOME>/bin/mule`
+
[TIP]
*`<MULE_HOME`>* is the value of the MULE_HOME variable employed by Mule, usually the root directory of the installation, such as `/opt/Mule/mule-standalone-3.8.0/`

. Navigate to the directory where the .zip file is located and copy the .zip file. Ensure that your copy of the file does not have any spaces in the name. 
. Drop the copy of the .zip file into the `<MULE_HOME>/apps` folder.
. Mule polls this folder for new applications every five seconds. Watch your command line window to track the progress of the deployment.
. When you see the message `Started app 'TshirtService'`, then your API is deployed to the Mule runtime.

If you wish to undeploy your application, navigate to the `app` directory and delete the file `your_application.txt`. This removes your application from the `/app` directory, which automatically undeploys it.

. Your project has a node in the Package Explorer. Right-click on the project node and then click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* > *Cloud* from the cascading menu.

. If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Studio stores your credentials and uses them automatically the next time you deploy to CloudHub. You can manage these credentials through the Studio Preferences menu, in Anypoint Studio > Authentication.
. After you sign in, the Deploy to Runtime Manager menu opens. Choose a unique domain in which to deploy the application. In this case, we enter helloworld (however, you can choose your own unique domain of up to 42 characters in length). When you choose a unique domain name, a green confirmation check mark displays. 
. Select an Environment and a Mule Version.
+
After you add your domain name, the Mule Version fills in automatically. Click *Finish*.

Anypoint Studio packages, uploads, and deploys your application to CloudHub.
. Browse to the URL of yourdomain.cloudhub.io (also shown in the pop-up window above). You should see your application running via the link:/runtime-manager[Runtime Manager].

To stop the application, click the *Settings* tab and click *Cancel deployment*.
